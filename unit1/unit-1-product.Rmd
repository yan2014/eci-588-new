## Questions

1.  What aspects of online professional learning resources do teachers find most valuable?

2.  How might online learning resources differ in the value they afford teachers?

## Methods

**Data Source**: Items pertaining educator role, resource type, and value of resource on RttT Online Resources Survey

**Data Processing**: Tokenized and tidied text

**Data Analysis**: Word Counts & Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency

# Findings

## Words Used to Describe Benefits

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
wordcloud2(opd_counts,
           color = ifelse(opd_counts[, 2] > 1000, 'black', 'gray'))
```

## Top 20 Words

```{r}
opd_counts %>%
  filter(n > 500) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Word Counts", y = NULL) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## Information Shared

```{r, eval=F}
opd_teacher <- read_csv("data/opd_survey.csv") %>%
  select(Role, Resource, Q21) %>%
  rename(text = Q21) %>%
  slice(-1, -2) %>%
  filter(Role == "Teacher")

select(opd_teacher, text) %>% 
  filter(grepl('inform*', text)) %>%
  sample_n(10)
```

"It could be completed at home in my free time. It had lots of good information that helped me understand the **terminology**."

"the information about the way our **common core** was created for our system"

"Informative information on the **21st century learner** and teacher."

"The most beneficial aspect was the information about **types of data** and where we get it from."

"This has already been implemented; I do not need to know this information at this point."

## Videos and Resources Provided

```{r, eval=F}

select(opd_teacher, text) %>% 
  filter(grepl('resource*', text)) %>%
  sample_n(10)

```

"All the videos and resources"

"**Printable resources** to keep on hand and example videos of how to use formative assessments in the classroom."

"I was able to see other **lesson plans** and resources that other schools are doing."

"Viewing **teacher videos**, especially Dan Meyer and Finland classroom. I was also introduced to new online resources that will aid my students and me in learning."

"This was not a beneficial resource to me as I do not teach nor will grade the MSLs for the subject areas targeted in this resource."

## Time and Pace for Learning

```{r, eval=F}

select(opd_teacher, text) %>% 
  filter(grepl('time', text)) %>%
  sample_n(10)

```

"The **ability to schedule the time to work** on the module so that it does not interfere with my commitments as an educator."

"time to **talk with peers**"

"The most valuable aspect was the time factor. This online module was my first. I did not realize I could **walk away and work on it at another time**, so this is a tremendous aspect for the online learner."

"Teachers are **able to go back to the information at anytime** to view the information to ensure understanding of the material."

"The **freedom** to work at my own pace."

## Words Emphasized in Each Resource

```{r, message=FALSE}

opd_resource_counts <- opd_clean %>%
  count(Resource, word)

total_words <- opd_resource_counts %>%
  group_by(Resource) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(n))

opd_words <- left_join(opd_resource_counts, total_words)

opd_tf_idf <- opd_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, Resource, n)

opd_tf_idf %>%
  filter(Resource != "Calendar") %>%
  group_by(Resource) %>%
  slice_max(tf_idf, n = 5) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Resource=as.factor(Resource),
         word=reorder_within(word, tf_idf, Resource)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = Resource)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~Resource, ncol = 3, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_reordered() +
  labs(y = "tf-idf value", x = NULL)

```

## Conclusions

1.  Teachers found the **information** shared beneficial, such as new terminology, the common core standards, and types of data.
2.  Teachers appreciated the **resources and videos** provided including lesson plans and printable materials.
3.  Use of words like time, pace, and format suggests teachers valued the **convenience** of online professional development.

## Discussion

-   **Limitations**: While able to provide quick insight into a large number of responses, analysis raised as many questions as it answered.\
-   **Implications**: Validation of design decisions such use of videos and inclusion of practical resources.\
-   **Next Steps for Analysis**: Dig into recommendations for improvement.
